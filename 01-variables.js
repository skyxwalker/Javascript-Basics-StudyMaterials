// 3 ways of variable declaration

var a = 20;
//var is the first method of variable declaration. it is basic methord .
//cons : it can be redeclared and reinitialized.
//pro : it is function scoped.

let b = 20;
//let is the second method of variable declaration. it is advanced methord .
//cons : it can be redeclared but not reinitialized.
//pro : it is block scoped.

const c = 20;
//const is the third method of variable declaration. it is advanced methord .
//cons : it can not be redeclared and reinitialized.
//pro : it is block scoped.

let d=true;//boolean
let e=10;//number
let f="hello world";//string
let g=null;//null
let h=undefined;//undefined
let l=10.5;//float

//incremental operator
let m=10;
let n=10;
